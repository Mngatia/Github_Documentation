Git is a free and open source distributed version control system where it every project no matter how small or big it is.

							TEATURES OF GIT	
- Speed: Git is very fast and scalable compared to other version control systems which handles large projects efficiently. 
		 It is 10 times faster than other VCS tools hence good for storing large files.
- Secure: Git keeps all commits done by each collaborators on the local copy of the development. 
		  If a problem raises then it can be easily tracked and handled. 
		  It uses SHA1 to store all the records in the form o objects in the hash.
- Open-Source: It is a free open source because it allows multiple people to work on the same project and also collaborate with each other easily
- Branching: The master branch contains the production quality code.
			 Branching and merging can be done with the help of a few Git commands. 
			 This allows its users to work on a line that runs parallel to the main project.
- Economical: It is available for free. All the operations are performed on the local machine before pushing it on to the central repository.
			  This helps in saving a lot of money on costly servers.
